# Rock Paper Scissors [The Odin Project - Foundation](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## [Version 1](https://junol-dev.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/):

- This is the first JavaScript project I built in The Odin Project foundation.
- For now, this game will be played via the browser console.
- This project will get updated with a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text in a later lesson.
